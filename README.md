## Challenge

The following is a transcription of the challenge as stated via email:

> **Cypress Exercise Prompt:** 
> Please install Cypress and create an automated test of the [snapdocs.com](https://snapdocs.com/) website:
> 1. Verify elements on the landing page you feel should be verified.
> 2. Navigate to the Notary Signing Agents page and include expectations/assertions to verify items you feel are important to verify.
> 3. Search for a notary by zip code:
>    1. A list of notaries and their information should appear. 
>    2. Verify results are returned. 
>    3. Verify the contents of a notary panel of your choosing.
> 4. *Bonus*: create an alias and use it in the spec.
>
>   **Notes**:
>
> If you are going to be using GitHub to complete your exercise, please make sure the repository is private and download into a zip drive [_sic_*].
>
> Please send finished exercise to [Max Gurfinkel](mailto:maximo.gurfinkel@snapdocs.com) and [Toni Neri](mailto:toni.neri@snapdocs.com) and make it shareable with the following team members:
> * [Patrick Francis](mailto:patrick.francis@snapdocs.com) 
> * [Cristian Brotto](mailto:cris@snapdocs.com) 
> * [Matt Middlesworth](mailto:matt.middlesworth@snapdocs.com)

\*Presumably, the phrase "zip drive" was intended to be "zipped file". I _used_ to have a [Zip Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive), but those days are long gone. :grin:

## Installation, Execution, Running Test Cases

To run the author's solution, you must first clone the repository and then install Cypress (if it is not already). 

_Presuppositions_: 

* Presumably, the user will be acquainted with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). If not, a quick video overview may be helpful:
  [![What is Cypress?](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/659967784_260x146.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/237527670?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0 "What is Cypress?")
* It is assumed the user already has both [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager) installed. If either of those are not installed, this exercise is left to the user and the search engine of their choice.
* It is further assumed that the user is familiar with a terminal on the platform of their choice.

### Installation & Execution of Cypress

1. Change directories to the location of one's choice (e.g., `c:\my_repos` or `~/Documents/my_repos`) and clone this repository: 
   `git clone git@github.com:GLMeece/snapdocs_cypress_takehome.git` 
   Alternately, you could download the repository as a zipped file and decompress it locally.
2. In a terminal, install Cypress: `npm install cypress`
3. Once installed, run the dashboard: `npx cypress open`
    You will see a dashboard appear: 
    ![Cypress Dashboard](cypress_dashboard.png)
6. Click on the **Run all specs** link.
7. The tests will execute rapidly, with a "fast-forward" sequence of events constituting the test cases being executed, along with their statuses along the way. It is not unusual to see some of the tests show request errors during the run.

## Test Case Execution

The following are my notes and commentary on how I addressed the exercise prompt, referencing the numbers as quoted above. There are additional thoughts and comments in the [Design Notes](#design-notes) section below.

---

>  1) Verify elements on the landing page you feel should be verified.

Tests are found in the `cypress/integration/landing-page.spec.js` file.

The landing page has a high degree of complexity. For the scope of this exercise, it would not be possible to explore all the elements and features present here. So, as a representative smoke tests, the test cases click on links to other segments of the website. These cases are divided by top links and body links.

For the top links (*Lenders*, *Title / Escrow*, *Notary Signing Agents*, *Resource Center*, *COVID-19 Guide*, *Sign In*, *Get Started*), each is clicked and it is verified that the URL conforms to the expected location on the site. A more robust test would verify critical elements on each of these pages, but that is left for another exercise.

For the body links (in the **Explore the Snapdocs digital closing platform** section), the _Learn more â†’_ links are clicked, again verifying that the correct URL is reached. For discussion on the selector approach, [see below](#selector-approach).

There is obviously significantly more that _should_ be done to verify the home page, but this smoke test subset is just a representative.

Additionally, upon landing, the Cookies prompt is accepted.

---

> 2) Navigate to the Notary Signing Agents page and include expectations/assertions to verify items you feel are important to verify.

Tests are found in the `cypress/integration/notary-signing-agents-page.spec.js` file.

* The tests verify that both the **Get Started** and **Activate Free Account** buttons lead to the _Perfect Closing_ page.
* Verified the sign-up fields for **Lender**, **Title / Escrow**, **Signing Service** and **Notary Signing Agent** are functional. Additionally, the Notary sign-up should trigger the CAPTCHA challenge (whereas the other sign-ups should not).

---

> 3) Search for a notary by zip code:
>   1. A list of notaries and their information should appear. 
>   2. Verify results are returned. 
>   3. Verify the contents of a notary panel of your choosing.

The tests are located in the `cypress/integration/notary-search-page.spec.js` file.

This file contains two positive tests, plus one (failing) negative one.

* It is verified that searching for zip code 78665 (coincidentally, the author's zip code) results in a list of notaries greater than zero.
* Verifies that clicking the _Read more..._ link opens up the detail page of the same notary selected on the previous page.
* For the negative test case, we assert on the fact that this is the only page the author found that is directly accessible from the home page that does not display the [GPDR cookie notice](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/). :grimacing:

---


> 4) *Bonus*: create an alias and use it in the spec.

This was addressed in the `cypress/integration/notary-signing-agents-page.spec.js` test file. Here is the relevant section:

```javascript
describe('Perfect Closing Signup page', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('more-info/?identity=Notary')
    acceptCookies()
    cy.get('#lender + label').as('lenderButton')
    cy.get('#title-escrow + label').as('titleEscrowButton')
    cy.get('#signing-service + label').as('signingServiceButton')
    cy.get('#notary + label').as('notaryButton')
  })
```

## Design Notes

The following indicates some of the design decisions I made and some of the issues I encountered. These notes are not organized by their level of signficance, rather just as they occurred to me while documenting the project.

### Container Your Enthusiasm

I generally use container technology such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to assure a uniform environment. The Cypress team does in fact [maintain Docker images](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/docker.html#Images) for this purpose. However, because this is a relatively small effort, and it plays well in a graphical environment, I decided against this approach. Maybe next time!

### Describe the Context

I've seen both `describe` and `context` used with Mocha-related examples, but [apparently they are the same thing](https://lmws.net/describe-vs-context-in-rspec), with **describe** being somewhat preferred. So, that's what I went with.

### XHR Errors

During test case execution, I noticed a number of [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) API GET requests that were either canceled or aborted. Were I involved with actual QA at Snapdocs, I would want to track down what was causing these errors. If they are old calls that are no longer needed, then the requests should be pruned from the code base as this can cause unneeded latency in the user experience.

### Selector Approach

To the extent I could, I followed the basic CSS hierarchy of preferred selectors (ids, class, tags, attributes, etc.). I could not [per the recommendation of the Cypress team](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Selecting-Elements), utilize the [custom Cypress tags mentioned promoted in the documents](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#Selector-Playground). However, whenever it made sense, I favored leveraging the selector presented by the Selector Playground widget in the app pane of the runner window. 

However, I discovered some things in the HTML which gave me pause in using the IDs as they were. For example, the **Get Started** button has an ID of `menu-item-730` which seems decidedly non-semantic. Not knowing the development and build process, I have no idea whether or not this ID string is fixed for eternity, or whether the numeric portion (i.e., `730`) will change upon the next incremented release. Because of this (my lack of assurance as to the stability of the ID):

```javascript
// Instead of this:
cy.get('#menu-item-730 > a').click()
// I chose this pattern:
cy.get('a').contains('Get Started').click()
```

### Page Objects vs. App Actions

[Page Objects](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) are [a well-established pattern for testing with Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects). However, [Cypress isn't Selenium](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/general-questions-faq.html#Does-Cypress-use-Selenium-Webdriver), and it encourages (and sometimes enforces) different paradigms. One of the paradigms it encourages is moving away from the Page Object patterns. The main objections to this design pattern can be found in the article [**Stop using Page Objects and Start using App Actions**](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/03/stop-using-page-objects-and-start-using-app-actions/#page-objects-problems).

Having pondered the author's points, reading [an article](https://medium.com/reactbrasil/deep-diving-pageobject-pattern-and-using-it-with-cypress-e60b9d7d0d91) and watching [a video tutorial](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/cypress-tutorial/chapter7.html) on using Page Objects with Cypress, and considering my experience with this pattern, I've elected to instead lean into this tried and true approach. Perhaps with more time and experience, I'll begin drinking this kool-aid and move towards the App Actions pattern instead. For now, Page Objects is my approach of choice.
